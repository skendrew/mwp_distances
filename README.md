# mwp_distances

This repository contains code to perform distance measurements to [Milky Way Project](http://www.milkywayproject.org) bubbles and associated HII regions using the Bayesian distance calculator from the BeSSeL project. BeSSeL stands for ["Bar and Spiral Structure Legacy Survey"](http://bessel.vlbi-astrometry.org/home), a VLBA key science project to study the structure and kinematics of the Milky Way Galaxy. The Bayesian distance calculation code is described in [Reid et al 2016](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016arXiv160402433R) and available from the proejct webpage. 

As input the scripts take the machine learning-improved catalog of large MWP bubbles (DR1), cross-macthed with the WISE HII region catalog and follow-up velocity measurements from [Anderson et al 2014](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJS..212....1A).

This repository is work in progress....
